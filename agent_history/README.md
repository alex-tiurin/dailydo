# Agent History

Per project constitution, after completing development of a feature, an aggregating file MUST be created here summarizing:

- Commands executed during the feature work
- Key decisions and artifacts produced
- Steps that can be repeated for audit or onboarding

Name files by feature or date (e.g. `feature-001-activity-list.md`, `2025-02-07-create-flow.md`).
